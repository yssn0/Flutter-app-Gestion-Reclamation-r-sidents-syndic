## Important Notes

### MongoDB Atlas and Firebase Configuration

The files `MongoDB Atlas`, `firebase_options.dart`, `Databasefirebase.json`, `atlasonfig.json`, and `google-services.json` contain sensitive information such as keys and app IDs. For security reasons, the values of these files have been changed.

To use this project, you must create your own MongoDB Atlas database and Firebase project, and replace the variables with your own keys and IDs.

### Creating a MongoDB Atlas Database

1. Go to the [MongoDB Atlas website](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and create an account.
2. Create a new cluster and database.
3. Create a new user and obtain the connection string.
4. Replace the `MongoDB Atlas` file with your own connection string.

### Creating a Firebase Project

1. Go to the [Firebase website](https://firebase.google.com/) and create an account.
2. Create a new Firebase project.
3. Enable the necessary services (e.g. Authentication, Realtime Database).
4. Obtain the Firebase configuration file (`google-services.json`) and replace the existing file.
5. Replace the `firebase_options.dart` file with your own Firebase options.

### Replacing Variables

Replace the following variables with your own keys and IDs:

* `appId` in `firebase_options.dart`
* `apiKey` in `firebase_options.dart`
* `databaseURL` in `Databasefirebase.json`
* `connectionString` in `MongoDB Atlas`
